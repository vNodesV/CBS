# kAtch

## Overview

`kAtch` is a module of `vServ` fromÂ `vNodes[V]`, aiming at making the life of blockchain Validators easier. It simplifies tasks like node monitoring, retrieving blockchain information, and checking statuses, reducing operational overhead for Validators and streamlining their workflows.

## Directory Structure

- `config/`
  - `node_config.sh`: Configuration file to define node-specific settings.

- `func/`
  - `check_status.sh`: Script to check the status of nodes.
  - `chain_info.sh`: Script to retrieve blockchain-related information.
  - `get_heights.sh`: Script to monitor and retrieve block heights.

- `kAtch.sh`
  - The main entry point script that sources configuration and function scripts to perform various tasks.

## Installation

To use `kAtch`, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vNodesV/vServ.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `kAtch` directory:

   ```bash
   cd vServ/kAtch
   ```

3. Ensure that the scripts have executable permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod +x kAtch.sh func/*.sh
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to start using `kAtch`:

```bash
./kAtch.sh
```

### Key Functionalities

- **Check Node Status:**

  ```bash
  ./func/check_status.sh
  ```

- **Retrieve Blockchain Information:**

  ```bash
  ./func/chain_info.sh
  ```

- **Monitor Block Heights:**

  ```bash
  ./func/get_heights.sh
  ```

## Configuration

Before running the scripts, ensure that the `config/node_config.sh` file is updated with the correct node and environment settings. This file is sourced by the main script and defines important parameters for your setup.
